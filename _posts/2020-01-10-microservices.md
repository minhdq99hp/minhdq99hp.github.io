## Definition
Microservices architecture has emerged as one of the best tools to control big software systemsm, enabled by new tools such as containers and orchestrators.

### The traditional monolith architecture
#### Disadvantages:
- The code will increase in size
- Inefficient utilization of resources
- Issues with development scalability
- Interdependency of technologies

A system following a microservices architecture is a *collection of loosely coupled specialized services that work in unison to provide a comprehensive service.*

#### Advantages of microservices
- Each microservice can be programmed in different languages, the communication between microservices is done through a standard protocol.
- Better resource utilization
- Better deal with dependencies.
- Some services can be hidden from external access -> improve security
- Allow for parallel development and deployment.

The microservices architecture is similar to the UNIX philosophy, applied to web services: write each program (service) to do one thing and do it well, write programs (services) to work together and write programs (services) to handle text streams (HTTP calls), because that is a universal interface.



## Some terms
- Spaghetti code: a common way of referring to code that lacks any structure and is difficult to read and follow.
